Project Description
The AirBnB Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool designed to manage properties and bookings for hosts and guests on the AirBnB platform. It provides a convenient way to interact with AirBnB's services through the command line, allowing users to perform various actions such as listing properties, making reservations, and managing accounts.

Command Interpreter Description
The AirBnB CLI is built using Python and provides a command-line interface for interacting with AirBnB's services. It utilizes AirBnB's API to communicate with the platform and perform actions on behalf of the user.

To start the AirBnB CLI, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the AirBnB CLI files.

How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the AirBnB CLI is running, you can start entering commands to interact with the platform. The syntax for using the CLI is as follows:
